# Random.Array
by Max Goldstein

Randomized functions on the Array data structure in Elm.

The implementations seem robust but should not be trusted when cryptographic
randomness is required. Tests of the shuffle algorithm are available in
`Test/grid.elm` and `Test/reference.html`.

Please submit issues and bugs through GitHub. Particularly welcome are
performance optimizations and (dis)proofs of statistical randomness.
